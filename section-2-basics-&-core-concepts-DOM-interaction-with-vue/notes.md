# To start:
- I need to create a Vue App, this is aways the first sep: I control a part of HTML using a vue app;
- Important: If we control a HTML element with Vue, we'll also control all child elements ofthat element!.
- Data has to be Data, it is a property key of vue;
- Interpolation: I can reference properties that makes part of my data in HTML, outpputing the value of the propety;
- v- (words with this at the begging are reserved words by vue)
- Methods: allows to define functions
    * IMPORTANT:
    Data itsef was a function a method, and Method takes an object full of methods (tose are tottaly up to me);
- Data and Interpolation (I'll aways use it)

    - Summary:
        - Vue uses declarative approach: we definine the templates, We mark the part that are dynamic and Vue does the rest for us behind the scenes on our behalf; We just declare our goal and don't care about the spets fo getting there. This is the opposite of imperative approacth (with only JS);
