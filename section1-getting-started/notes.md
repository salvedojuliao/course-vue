# What is vue?
- It is a JS framework that makes building interactive and reactive web frontends
    - JS: A programming language;
    - Framework: is a third-party library taht exposes utility functionalities AND a 'set of rules' (a clear guidance) on how to build your JS application (Functions + Rules);
    - Reactive: Your app is able to react to user input, update the screen dynamically (e.g. to show overlays or input validation erros) -> Look and feel of mobile apps.
    - Web frontends: What the user sees (HTML + CSS + JS, running in the browser of your user)
    - Mobile app and desktop app feel very "reactive": things happen instantly, you don't wait for new pages to load or actiosn to star.
        - Trandicionally, in web apps, you click a link and wait for a new page to load. You click a button and wait for some action to complete.
        - JS is used to helps us make it reactive "Behind the scenes"
            * But "Just JS" may not be ideal!

    * Conclusion: Using Vue makes everybody be in the same page!

# Different Ways of Using Vue
- In two main ways:
    1) Control parts of HTML pages or entire pages, some pages only.
    2) Controle EVERYTHING (teh enrite frontend) of a web application. (Single-Page-Application - SPA).
    The goal of the course: start first approach tehn move to the second one.

Obs: "VanillaJS is a name to refer to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery back in the days.
