# Sction 1: Getting Started
* What is Vue.js?
    - It is as JavaScript framework that makes building interactive and reactive web frontends (= browswer-side web applications) easier.

    - Framework: It is a (trhid-party) library that exposes utility functionalities AND 'a set of rules' (a clear guidance) on how to build your Javascript application.

    - Reactive: Your app is able to react to user input, update the screen dynamically (e.g to show overlays or input validation erros) -> Look and feel of mobile apps.

    HOWEVER: Using 'vanilla' JavaScript I need to write all code by my own ('re-invent the wheel'), that's here vue helps us, I can work better in a team, where everyone knows the structure.

    In short: When I use a framewor, I can make mobile apps and desktop apps feel very 'reacive': Things happen instantly, you don't wait for new pages to load or actions to start.
